# Chapter 2 Challenge 

# Stock-Analysis

## 1. Project Overview:

Refactoring code that we created during Module 2 - VBA of Wall Street that analyzes stock options in order for the script to run faster. 

## 2. Results:

In the original code, running the analysis on 2017 runs in 0.5898438 seconds and the refactored code runs in 0.08203125 seconds
In the original code, running the analysis on 2018 runs in 0.5859375 seconds and the refactored code runs in 0.0859375 seconds
